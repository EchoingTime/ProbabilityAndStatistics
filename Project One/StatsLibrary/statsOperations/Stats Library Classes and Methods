|											|    Chapter 1    |												|
|																											|
| MeanMedianModeSD Class | Contains methods for finding Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation and Variance	|
|___________________________________________________________________________________________________________|
|																											|
|											|    Chapter 2    |												|
|																											|
| UnionIntersectonComplement Class | Contains methods for Set Theory, such as Union, Intersection, 			|
| and Compliment 																							|
|																											|
| CombinationPermutationFactorial Class | Contains methods for finding Factorial, Permutations, and 		|
| Combinations																								|
|																											|
| ConditionalBayesDependence Class | Contains methods for finding and utilizing Conditional Probability,	| 
| Bayes-Theorem, finding the dependence and independence, finding mutually exclusive sets, and finding		|
| the intersection and union probabilities of either dependent or independent sets and mutually exclusive   |
| or not mutually exclusive sets, respectively. 															|

|											|    Chapter 3    |											 	|
|																											|
| Distributions Class | Contains methods for distributions, such as Geometric, Binomial, Hyper Geometric,   |
| Negative Binomial, Possion, and Tchebysheffâ€™s Theorem. Also accounts for their expected and variances		|
| in respective methods. Does not include standard deviation as this is redundant and can be retrieved by	|
| square rooting the result via variance methods.															|
